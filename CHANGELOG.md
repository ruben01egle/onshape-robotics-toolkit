# Changelog

## [Unreleased] — fork changes

### Bug Fixes

* fix mate-limit fetch discarding limits for an entire assembly when any feature has an unrecognized "explosion" featureType
* fix revolute joint axis sign (was `0 0 -1`, now `0 0 1`) and apply the corresponding limit negate-and-swap already used by prismatic joints, so joint limits stay physically correct
* snap floating-point noise in `<origin>` xyz/rpy values to exact `0` below a `1e-6` threshold, without touching inertia tensor or mass values

### Features

* add `uniform_link_color` option to `Robot.from_graph()` (default gray `(0.5, 0.5, 0.5, 1.0)`) instead of a random color per link; pass `None` to restore the old random-per-part behavior
* add `root_mate_name` parameter to `KinematicGraph.from_cad()` to select the kinematic root via a named mate-to-origin, avoiding the need for a throwaway dummy fixed part
* move `xacro_export.py`'s URDF-to-xacro conversion into the package as `onshape_robotics_toolkit.formats.xacro`
* **breaking:** `convert_urdf_to_xacro` appends a fixed `flange` link/joint (`flange_xyz`, `flange_rpy`) instead of `tcp` (`tcp_offset_z` removed) and validates `tip_link`
* add `convert_tool_urdf_to_xacro` for end-effector tools exported from their own assembly: `tool` macro with a `parent` param, prefixed names, an unprefixed `tcp` frame and meshes under `meshes/tools/<tool_name>/`
